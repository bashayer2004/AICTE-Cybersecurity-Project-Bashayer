Project Title:

  =>"Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography" is a project that involves embedding secret data inside an image in a way that it remains hidden from unauthorized users. 
     The primary goal is to ensure confidentiality and prevent detection by unauthorized parties.

Project Overview:

  =>In this project, we will use Steganography, a technique that hides information within digital media, to securely embed a secret message or file inside an image. The image will appear unchanged to a casual observer, but the hidden data can be extracted using a specific algorithm.

Project Objectives:

*Implement Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography or other steganographic techniques.

*Ensure the hidden data is not easily detectable or alterable.

*Develop an encryption mechanism to enhance security.

*Create a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages.

*Support various image formats like PNG, BMP, or JPEG.


Technology Stack:

*Programming Language: Python, Java, or C++

*Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library)

*GUI (Optional): Tkinter (Python), Java Swing

*Encryption (Optional): AES or RSA for enhanced security


Implementation Steps:

1. Image Selection: Load an image where data will be hidden.


2. Data Preprocessing: Convert the secret message into binary format.


3. Steganographic Embedding: Modify the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values to embed the message.


4. Image Output: Save the modified image without noticeable visual changes.


5. Extraction Process: Implement a decoding algorithm to retrieve the hidden data.


6. Encryption (Optional): Encrypt the data before embedding it for extra security.


7. Testing: Check image quality and accuracy of data retrieval.



Expected Output:

*A tool that can hide and retrieve text messages within images securely.

*A system that prevents unauthorized access to hidden data.

*A comparison of different steganographic techniques for effectiveness.


Future Enhancements:

*Support for audio and video steganography.

*Integration with Machine Learning to detect steganographic content.

*Steganalysis defense mechanisms to avoid detection by attackers.
